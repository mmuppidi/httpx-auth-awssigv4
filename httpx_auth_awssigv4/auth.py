class SigV4Auth:
    """Auth class to provide AWS Sigv4 authentication support to httpx library.

    When we send API requests to AWS, we need to sign the requests so that AWS can identify who sent them. To sign the
    requests we use Signature V4 process to sign API requests. Instantiation of this class creates an auth object that
    python httpx library can use to sign the API requests before sending them to AWS.

    Note:
        This class only supports adding authorization header as part of the request and doesn't support adding
        authorization header in query string

    Usage:


        import httpx
        from httpx_auth_awssigv4 import Sigv4Auth

        auth = Sigv4Auth(

            url="https://<API ID>.execute-api.<Region>.amazonaws.com/prod/detials",
            params={"username": "tstark"},
